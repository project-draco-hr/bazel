'DEPRECATED:  Declares the RPC service interfaces.\n\nThis module declares the abstract interfaces underlying proto2 RPC\nservices.  These are intended to be independent of any particular RPC\nimplementation, so that proto2 services can be used on top of a variety\nof implementations.  Starting with version 2.3.0, RPC implementations should\nnot try to build on these, but should instead provide code generator plugins\nwhich generate code specific to the particular RPC implementation.  This way\nthe generated code can be more appropriate for the implementation in use\nand can avoid unnecessary layers of indirection.\n'
