def Modified(self):
    "Called every time the message is modified in such a way that the parent\n    message may need to be updated.  This currently means either:\n    (a) The message was modified for the first time, so the parent message\n        should henceforth mark the message as present.\n    (b) The message's cached byte size became dirty -- i.e. the message was\n        modified for the first time after a previous call to ByteSize().\n        Therefore the parent should also mark its byte size as dirty.\n    Note that (a) implies (b), since new objects start out with a client cached\n    size (zero).  However, we document (a) explicitly because it is important.\n\n    Modified() will *only* be called in response to one of these two events --\n    not every time the sub-message is modified.\n\n    Note that if the listener's |dirty| attribute is true, then calling\n    Modified at the moment would be a no-op, so it can be skipped.  Performance-\n    sensitive callers should check this attribute directly before calling since\n    it will be true most of the time.\n    "
